Double-blind peer review mechanism has become the skeleton of academic research across multiple disciplines, 
yet several studies have questioned the quality
of peer reviews and raised concerns on potential biases in the process.
Although studying the peer-review process is of interet to many,
features derived from textual data such as reviews or submissions
are underused.
This database tracks the latest International Conference
on Learning Representations (ICLR) submissions/reviews/author profiles
and conveniently packs metadata together with textual features for downstream analysis.


## Getting Started


### Getting the Database

The latest version can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iaps6dityc18kif/cs_conf_release.db?dl=1) (2017-2022),
as a ``sqlite3`` database.

### Companion Paper and Example Notebooks

The notebook ``paper_summary.ipynb`` contains instructions to reporduce figures and tables in the companion paper,
and the notebook ``analysis_glm.ipynb`` performs association studies via linear models.
